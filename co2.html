        "सरकारें आएंगी, जाएंगी, पार्टियां बनेंगी, बिगड़ेंगी मगर ये देश रहना चाहिए।" - अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी<br>

The linguistic and cultural multiplicity of India is her saving grace, on most days. On the other few, it has been deemed to be a potential tendency to divide her.<br>

The hope of Jawarharlal Nehru’s government was that the various states would be large and heterogeneous and such composite states would discourage the emergence of parochial identities. However, it was not to be.<br>

Various social and cultural groups started demanding the creation of the following states. The major demands are:
<br>
1. Bodoland, Gorkhaland and Greater Nagalim in the North East<br>
2. Purvanchal and Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh<br>
3. Vidarbha and Saurashtra in the West<br>

"The care of the public health is the first duty of the statesman." – Benjamin Disraeli<br>

The Public Health (Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) Bill, 2017 was prepared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and would supersede the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897, if passed in the parliament.<br>

From the definition of a Public Health Emergency to the division of powers among the administrative authorities, the Public Health Bill, 2017 is much more comprehensive than any of the previous acts.<br>
However, the Bill wasn’t even tabled in the parliament.
<br>
The need of the hour is to have an Act which takes into account all the threats to public health and integrates all health related laws to strengthen the response to any Public Health Emergency, and we hand over this responsibility to you.
<br>
Greetings Delegates!<br>
We present before you The Rajya Sabha of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
<br>
On one front, cultural diversity is challenging the integrity of the nation, while on the other hand, lack of an effective framework for public healthcare has intensified the health crisis. Your voice can dawn a new era of change in the country. Use it judiciously!
<br>
जय हिन्द!<br>
