          <p class="read-more-wrap" style="color: white; text-align: left;">While the world pats itself on the back for becoming one global
family, the truth is that we still have a long way to go to
actually forge that bond. Globalization has surely helped us
achieve tremendous progress, but somewhere in the process,
the essence of belonging to each other has evaporated. We
seem to be bound to each other not by a Universal Spirit but
the very things that cause irreversible harm to it. <br>
While nations increase the strength of their armies, they hardly
have the courage to hold an open and truthful discussion with
each other, while we talk of being a global citizen, we find it
difficult to accept and transform our own flaws. Terrorism has
become a problem which seems to have no visible solution in
the near future. In a race to outdo each other, the factor of
Human Unity is completely lost and it is only a radical change
in human consciousness that can alleviate our plight.<br>
Sri Aurobindo had said, “Nothing but a radical change of
consciousness can save humanity from the terrible plight into
which it is plunged.” These words, spoken in another era for
another generation, hold as much value and relevance today as
they did then.<br>
This radical change of consciousness can happen only if young
minds imbibe values of Human Unity through a gentle but
conscious transformation of their being, by focusing as much
on spiritual education as on academic excellence. It is only
when the youth become conscious individuals, conscious not
only of their outer progress but also conscious of their inner
progress, that they will take steps to promote harmony, peace
and brotherhood in the community at large.</p>
     <p class="read-more-wrap" style="color: white; text-align: left;">
     	It is only a conscious transformation of the emotional and
mental nature of young adults which will make them more
aware of their responsibility, responsibility not only towards
their own advancement but a mindful responsibility towards
Mother Nature, towards humanity at large. Such inspired minds
will take it upon themselves to foster the spirit of Human Unity
among all, or what is known as Vasudhaiva Kutumbakum, the
whole world is one family.<br>Educational institutions need to go beyond conventional
teaching and create curriculums which foster, through the
component of spiritual education, the spirit of Human Unity in
their students. And this must be done gradually, through a well
curated educational programme, from Playgroup to Grade 12.
This is where exercises like the Model United Nations also come
into play. They not only educate students on the delicate socio-
political balance of nations, but also help them understand the
bigger picture, the universal spirit of equality, fraternity and
brotherhood. <br>I invite students of different schools to participate in Jaipuria
MUN heartily. Together may you all raise the consciousness of
the Universe with your good will!
