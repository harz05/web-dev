        “Ideas are far more powerful than guns. We don't let our enemies have guns. Why should we let them have ideas?” – Joseph Stalin
<br>
Berlin, Germany.<br>June, 1948.<br>

World War II has come to an end, leaving Nazi Germany in ruins and divided into four occupation zones with the Eastern side under the control of the Soviet Union and the remaining under the three western allies, Britain, France and the United States of America. The Allied powers, have decided to unite their zones into a Capitalist Federal Republic of Germany while the German Democratic Republic has been established in the Soviet zone. The simmering tensions and increasing hostility between the Soviet and its former allies are primarily caused owing to the problem of reparations after the Second World War. The Soviet claims that the West Germany refused to recognize East Germany as an independent country because they wish to take over the North Eastern portion of Germany which is far within the Soviet administered zone.<br>

The situation in Berlin has exploded into a full blown crisis as the Soviets alarmed by these developments have blocked all rail, road and canal access to the western zones of Berlin unless the Deutschmark is withdrawn. A blockade that will rend East and West Germany apart,curb the rising tide of Capitalism and bring an end to the katzenjammer.<br>

Having been trusted with the responsibility to control the eastern portion of Germany, The Soviet Military Administration Council, is in desperate need of your help. The Allies are trying to crack open the blockade, at this very moment. The clock is ticking, every 45 seconds, the Allied aircrafts are landing in West Berlin with supplies. You need to move at full pelt to preclude the flow of supplies from the USAF and the RAF while you also have to defend the blockade. Now, it is entirely in your hands, delegates, to make swift and ingenious decisions in order to manoeuvre your country in making the Berlin Blockade a triumphant endeavour.
<br>
Dear delegates, we present to you The Soviet Military Administration Council of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
