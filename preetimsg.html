Nothing like living through a pandemic to make us understand why Jane Austen’s readers swooned when Mr. Darcy said, “I trust your family is in good health.” Likewise, I hope this reaches you in wholesomeness.
While the past year has made us familiarize with the truth that life is a very uncertain deal, and it is ending one day at a time, it has also awoken us to the fact that there is a lot to be thankful for- everyday.<br>
The mind is rendered conscious of the unfortunate battles that the world faces today. The external conflicts have aligned themselves with those internally and every man fights a foe- from six feet apart, of course.
We see that the troubles are not modernist, but the oblivion towards the issues has been catered to in the modern world. Today, peace is sensitized, and peace breakers are penalized; leaders are cooperated with, and dictators are sidelined; justice is supreme, and the lack of it is intolerable; and although we still have a long way to go, the world is more demanding now than ever, and rightly so.
Today, we need questions, we need answers, we need rebuttals, we need resolutions. The need of the hour are forums- on all levels, that let us channel our questions, answers, rebuttals, and resolutions. Today, we need to go the extra mile in the dream of a better tomorrow.<br>
At the Jaipuria Model United Nations, we acknowledge the need to deliberate our agenda, defend our purpose and deliver the best of our knowledge. As we look back upon the glory of our last seven editions, we feel the tremors will be shakier this time.<br>
We sincerely welcome you to the eighth, and the first virtual edition of the Jaipuria Model United Nations. From striving for excellence as means to attain perfection to redefining perfection and striving for excellence, in its quest alone, we have outpaced our potential.
Mark your calendars for the 23rd-25th July 2021. The season to deliberate, defend and deliver is here.
We look forward to having fruitful discussions in the global interest and hope you will take back good learning from here.<br>
Regards,<br>The MUN Coordinator.<br>Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.</p>
