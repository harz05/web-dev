        "No custodian of the truth should have to fear their deliverance of the facts." - Jacob Riggs<br>

The media began as an instrument for instant information about our surroundings; from socio-political events and public policy, to economy, global affairs and everything in
between. While the media's functions remain constant, the manner in which it is perceived has dynamically shifted from the earth to the sky.
<br>

Journalistic ethics and standards comprise principles and sets of practices necessary to be followed by journalists, which include accuracy and impartiality among others, and promote confidence in the media. However, recent trends suggest the guardian of people's rights is losing the faith of the people.<br>


Referring to the Edelman survey, 59% suggested “journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations".<br>

But despite the criticisms, journalism remains the foremost source for general awareness, even as it has been tainted by power hungry vultures who have altered the notion of journalism. A multitude of allegations surround the press, ranging from media bias, shocking representation of sensitive news, and misinterpreted statements that often stir up unnecessary
disturbance.With the rain of accusations drenching the notion of journalism, it is now up to the journalists- to let it drown them or fight against the current and be acquitted.

Greetings, delegates.<br>

We present to you The Global Press Summit of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.<br>


A unique Jaipurian legacy, the GPS is a specialised International Press committee with a media department. The reporters will compose articles throughout the conference alongwith deliberating about real-world scenarios during rigorous in-committee sessions, and with meticulous strokes and encapsulating portrayals the caricaturists will bring out the essence of the conference.
This July, we give you the chance to restore power to the Fourth Estate and to ensure that it retains- above all- its ability to speak.
<br>

Regards,<br>

The Secretariat.<br>
