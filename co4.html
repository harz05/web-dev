        "Organised Crime is the Dirty Side of the Sharp Dollar" - Raymond Chandler<br>

From trafficking of humans and animals, to illegal trading of plant products and drugs, crime groups have changed from domestic organized crime groups to regional and then into a global illegitimate organisation, giving rise to the concept of Transnational Organised Crime; with the major hotspot areas being South-East Asia, Northern Africa, Middle-East Asia etc.<br>

COVID-19 has unexpectedly changed the lives of individuals and the dynamics regulating social, economic and environmental development. While the whole world was struggling against the onslaught of this pandemic, the Transnational Organised Crime groups saw it as a golden opportunity to further sink their claws into the map by taking advantage of the delicate situation of the current world.<br>

This unprecedented rise in the levels of Transnational Organised Crime show that organised crime groups have adapted a new course of action to the new COVID-19 realities, finding new routes for illicit trafficking and smuggling of falsified medicines, money laundering and cyber-crimes.<br>
As far as Human Trafficking is concerned, traffickers particularly target the migrants and people without jobs and the ones arriving to their native nations. The COVID-19-induced recession has exposed more people to the risk of trafficking.

Greetings Delegates, we present to you The United Nations General Assembly of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
<br>
With world changing with every passing second, we are still following the decades old convention of 15th November, 2000 for a predicament as mercurial as Transnational Organised Crime. Are we on the right path? We leave that for you to deliberate upon.
