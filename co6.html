       “History does not eliminate grievances. It lays them down with landmines.” - AN Wilson<br>

Landmines are often referred to as the “perfect soldier” for a good reason- they stay well-hidden in the ground years after being planted. If an unfortunate victim accidentally triggers one even half a century after a conflict has ended, they explode, taking away the valuable lives of countless innocent people.<br>

The availability of landmines contributes to the permanent 'militarization' of daily life. Wherever deployed, most often mines outlive their legitimate military objective and end up contaminating large tracts of land.<br>

After witnessing certain catastrophic usage of landmines, on the 18th of September, 1997, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention was adopted that provides a framework for mine action and bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines. Despite these efforts, the use of landmines and their devastating effects continue to spread at a fast rate.<br>

Where does the problem lie then? Why did the Secretary-General urge the Council ‘to strengthen efforts to further integrate mine action into relevant resolutions’ and press countries that have not yet done so, to accede to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, in the April 2021 session of the Council?<br>

Greetings, delegates!<br>
You were missed and so was your potential to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver. World leaders look forward to providing this already troubled world a sense of peace and security.<br>

We present to you the United Nations Security Council of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
