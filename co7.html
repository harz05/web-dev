        “It’s co-existence or no existence.”~Bertrand Russell<br>

WHO is a specialized agency of the UN, responsible for international public health. It plays an essential role in global governance of health and disease as it coordinates multiple actors towards a common goal. For this purpose it monitors public health risks and formulates guidelines.<br>

So here we are, bringing you a Beginners’ Committee for our fresh MUN zealots! We exclusively welcome 7-9 graders in this committee for learning necessary tactics essential for conferencing in an atmosphere unmanipulated by clever diplomacy, such that they find themselves comfortable and intelligible enough to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver.<br>

One of the multiple apprehensions that the pandemic has given us is the urgent need for planning a healthcare system which is inclusive, impartial and focuses on the need of the hour; vaccine distribution. A regular and unprejudiced health system should be guided by our principle of Universal Health Coverage, “ensuring that everyone has access to needed health services of sufficient quality to be effective while also ensuring that their use does not expose the user to financial hardship.”<br>

Wealthy countries have always secured more doses than they need to vaccinate their population, as in the case of the H1N1 flu pandemic and malaria. Poor countries, solely dependent on COVAX for their supplies, find themselves at the mercy of affluent economies like the European Union and the United States.
<br>
We need to facilitate transfer of knowledge and technology through voluntary licensing. This is a wake up call for setting up refocused, rejuvenated vaccination campaigns with equity in mind for the next crisis. Each life matters in our world and leaders need to embody global solidarity in every aspect.
<br>
Dear delegates, we present to you The World Health Organization of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
