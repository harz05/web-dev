        “It is time we see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals.”<br>
~Emma Watson
<br>
‘Gender equal socio-economic recovery’ demands demolishing regressive mindsets that thrive in the form of societal norms. Why do equal pay, unbiased promotions and leadership unhindered by gender not find their way into reality? Has the importance of equity been understood and enacted in order to reach the parity we desire to find in economic sectors?
<br>
It's a question about strengthening the foundation for a sustainable, prosperous world.
<br>
Since the 1980s, the internet has had immense success in connecting people across the world, regardless of their positions or identities. Now in 2021, as technology opens new frontiers of productivity and provides opportunities to people and societies, it has begun to pose a major risk of exclusion. A majority of the world population, belonging to minority genders, and most in developing countries, are still unable to gain internet access. Even after the UN declared 'internet access' to be a human right in 2016, gender-driven imbalance in access to Information and Communications technology (ICTs) has only continued to increase.
<br>
The pandemic led to a 67% increase in violence against gender minorities all over the world. Job losses, school closures and rising poverty have only added to their suffering. In the opening session of the Commission on the Status of Women, speakers described equal representation as the “game-changer” this world is in urgent need of.
Gender equality is at the very heart of United Nations values. In the new era, none can be left behind due to disturbing reasons like habits of economic systems. It's the right time to act so that the gaping gender digital gap could be filled.
