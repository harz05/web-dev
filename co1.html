       “Hope can be bruised and battered. It can be forced underground and even rendered unconscious, but hope cannot be killed.” -Neal Shusterman

1960.<br>
The eastern Mediterranean sea.<br>

The Republic of Cyprus was established following the Zurich and London Agreements with Greece, Britain and Turkey. Given Cyprus' largely bicommunal society, the treaty provided for the constitutional allocation of government posts and public offices according to ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto and granting the three states guarantor rights.
<br>
The division of powers resulted in impasses, discontent, and nationalist militants. The demand for an enosis with Greece re-emerged from unresolved disputes, and violence erupted over constitutional changes by President Markarios III.
<br>
Following the violence, joint Cypriot administration ended. Alongside the altering of the Republic's structure, the capital was divided by a buffer zone- the Green Line, by the UN peacekeepers.
As peace attempts persisted, the resolve for enosis strengthened.
<br>
Peace talks subsided when a coup d'état was launched in Cyprus by the Greek military junta on 15th July 1974, making enosist Nikos Sampson President. Turkey invaded Cyprus and captured northern territory in response. Resultantly, both Greek regimes fell and Glafkos Clerides became Acting President. The guarantors convened at Geneva for peace talks.
<br>
When the immediate demand for a Cypriot federal state wasn't met, Turkey launched an occupation of Cyprus.
<br>
The two powers are now restless.
<br>
There is an ancient enemy to fight and sovereignty to establish in the dream of finally prevailing over wrath. There is a lot to cater to, at hand.
<br>

Dear delegates, we present to you The Emergency Meeting of the Council of Ministers and the National Guard of Cyprus, 1974 of Jaipuria Model United Nations 2021.
<br>
Time is running out, the Turkish operation is escalating, and the Greek Cypriots risk expulsion from their patrída.
Must we make war to live in peace?
